4. **Pricing Structure Updates:** Corrected pricing based on current market rates
5. **Elimination of Duplicate Costs:** Removed redundant storage costs and updated service plans

## Enhanced Cost Reduction Recommendations

### Immediate Cost Savings (35-45% Potential Reduction)

| Area | Current Approach | Recommended Approach | Monthly Savings |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **WhatsApp Messaging** | Business-initiated rate (₹0.75/msg) | Use approved templates (₹0.35/msg) for 80% of messages | ₹32,000 |

## Notes on WhatsApp Business API Pricing

1. **Current Pricing Model:** WhatsApp now uses a conversation-based pricing structure
2. **Conversation Types:**
   - Business-initiated: ₹0.75-₹0.85 per conversation (India rates)
   - User-initiated: ₹0.30-₹0.35 per conversation (within 24-hour window)
   - Template messages: ₹0.35-₹0.45 per message (approved templates)
3. **Volume Discounts:** Available for very high volumes (100,000+ conversations)
4. **Country Variations:** Rates vary by recipient country; estimates based on India rates

## Notes on Tamil Voice Processing

1. **Language Complexity:** Tamil speech recognition requires specialized models from OpenAI
2. **Accuracy Considerations:** 
   - Base accuracy with OpenAI Whisper: 85-90% for clear audio
   - Dialect variations may require additional fine-tuning
3. **Processing Time:** OpenAI systems process audio at approximately 1.5-2x real-time for transcription and analysis
4. **Cost Reduction Options:**
   - Batch processing recordings with OpenAI APIs during off-peak hours
   - Using OpenAI's compression techniques to reduce audio file sizes
   - Progressive training of OpenAI models to improve accuracy over time

## Important Considerations

- WhatsApp Business API requires a verified business and may take 2-3 weeks for approval
- Pricing subject to change by third-party providers
- Usage-based costs are estimates and will vary based on actual customer engagement
- Consider A/B testing different message formats to optimize response rates
- Tamil speech recognition accuracy improves with system usage and model refinement
- IVR system should use clear voice prompts to improve response quality
