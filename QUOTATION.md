## Cost Optimization Suggestions

1. **Batch Processing:** Reduce n8n workflow executions by processing customers in batches
2. **WhatsApp Templates:** Use approved templates to benefit from lower message rates (₹0.35 vs. ₹0.80)
3. **Caching for OpenAI:** Implement response caching to reduce API calls by 30-40%
4. **Tiered Outreach:** Contact high-value prospects first, then expand based on response
5. **Self-hosting:** n8n can be self-hosted to potentially reduce costs for larger deployments

## Notes on WhatsApp Business API Pricing

1. **Registration Process:** Requires business verification through Meta's process
2. **Message Types:**
   - Session Messages (24-hour window): Lower costs (₹0.30-₹0.80 depending on country)
   - Template Messages (outside 24-hour window): Higher costs (₹0.80-₹2.00)
3. **Volume Discounts:** Available for very high volumes (100,000+ messages)
4. **Country Variations:** Rates vary by recipient country; estimates based on India rates

## Notes on OpenAI API Usage

1. **Model Selection:** GPT-4 is significantly more expensive than GPT-3.5 Turbo
2. **Token Usage:** Estimated 200-500 tokens per customer interaction
3. **Optimization:** Prompt engineering can reduce token usage by 25-30%
4. **Alternative Models:** Local models or Azure OpenAI may provide cost advantages

## Important Considerations

- WhatsApp Business API requires a verified business and may take 2-3 weeks for approval
- Pricing subject to change by third-party providers
- Usage-based costs are estimates and will vary based on actual customer engagement

For maximum cost efficiency, we recommend starting with a pilot of 1,000 customers to establish actual usage patterns before scaling to the full customer base.
