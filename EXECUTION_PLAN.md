- [ ] Create unified reporting dashboard across channels
- [ ] Set up automated triggering of appropriate follow-up actions
- [ ] Test full system integration with real customer scenarios

### Week 14: Full Deployment & Documentation

- [ ] Scale IVR system to full capacity
- [ ] Train team on voice system monitoring and maintenance
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for all system components
- [ ] Implement security audits and data protection measures
- [ ] Establish ongoing optimization and monitoring procedures

## Key Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **WhatsApp Verification Delay**: Begin process early, have email-only fallback ready
2. **Tamil Transcription Accuracy**: Implement human review for low-confidence transcriptions
3. **Cost Management**: Implement progressive batching and monitor API usage closely
4. **System Performance**: Load test before full deployment, implement auto-scaling
5. **Data Security**: Implement encryption, access controls, and compliance checks

## Success Metrics

- **Delivery Rate**: >98% successful message/call delivery
- **Response Rate**: >15% positive engagement with campaign
- **Transcription Accuracy**: >85% accurate Tamil transcription
- **Intent Classification**: >90% correct intent categorization
- **Cost Efficiency**: Maintain costs within quoted budget
