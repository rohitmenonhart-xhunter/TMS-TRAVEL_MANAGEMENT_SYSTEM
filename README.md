# Trip Planning Automation System

## Overview

This system automates customer outreach and trip planning processes through multi-channel communication (WhatsApp, Email, IVR) and intelligent processing of customer responses. The system is designed to handle high-volume campaigns (50,000+ messages) with optimized costs.

## Key Features

### Phase 1: Messaging Automation
- **Multi-Channel Outreach**: WhatsApp and Email campaigns to 50,000 customers
- **Document Sharing**: Link-based sharing of travel documents
- **Smart Follow-ups**: Automated follow-ups with responsive customers (8,000 prioritized leads)
- **Intent Classification**: AI-powered understanding of customer responses

### Campaign Response Flow
![Campaign Flow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Campaign+Flow+Diagram)

**Important**: Only responses received from the initial campaign will be processed through the agentic system. This targeted approach ensures:
1. Cost optimization by focusing AI resources only on engaged customers
2. Higher quality interactions with customers who have shown interest
3. Efficient use of system resources by filtering out non-responsive contacts

The workflow follows these steps:
1. Initial campaign sent to all 50,000 contacts
2. System captures and classifies responses (approximately 8,000 expected)
3. Only these responsive customers' messages are processed by the AI system
4. Non-responsive contacts receive no further automated processing

### Phase 2: Voice Processing Automation
- **IVR System**: Automated call handling with Tamil language support
- **Tamil Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper-powered transcription of Tamil audio
- **Context Analysis**: Extraction of customer intents and requirements from voice recordings
- **Data Integration**: Automated enrichment of customer profiles with voice interaction data
